So while I know some things about coding, I am honestly guessing my way though this right now. I love listening finding new songs, watching random movies/tv shows, and hanging out with friedns. (Keshi released a new song on the same day as Jojo Siwa 0.0)\n I don't really know what to make a blog about, my life if pretty boring. So I thought I would give you a day in my life, cause that's all I can think of at the moment.",

        "body": "I saw that in order to open up vs code, I had to open the app and install the shell command. (uninstall and reinstall each time I open a react app). \n Also I am not sure why, but adding the router is breaking my laptop. I got over 100 vulnerabilites (14 being critical). So idk how to go about that. \n But anyway... I got the free fries at McDonalds but they ran out of the jjk sauce. Other than that, I am currently working at Aliamam Tea where I spend my days making drinks and serving mochi donuts and creme puffs. Feel free to come for a 20% discount! I didn't really do much else besides cramming this blog at night :(",
