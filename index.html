      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

(Keshi released a new song on the same day as Jojo Siwa 0.0)\n I don't really know what to make a blog about, my life if pretty boring.

So idk how to go about that. \n But anyway... I got the free fries at McDonalds but they ran out of the jjk sauce. Other than that, I am currently working at Aliamam Tea where I spend my days making drinks and serving mochi donuts and creme puffs. Feel free to come for a 20% discount!
